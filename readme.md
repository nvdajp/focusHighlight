By drawing a colored rectangle, this addon enables partially sighted users, sighted educators, or developers to track the location of the nvda navigator object and the focused object/control.

The following colors are used by this addon:

* Green thin dashed-dotted line rectangle shows NVDA is in browse mode, and this is the navigator object.
* Red thin rectangle shows NVDA is in browse mode, and this is the focused object/control.
* Red thick rectangle shows NVDA is in browse mode, and this is both the navigator object and the focused object which are overlapping.
* Blue thick dotted line rectangle indicates NVDA is in focus mode, i.e., key types are passed to the control.

To toggle object tracking, press NVDA+Alt+P. You can assign other gestures using the Input Gestures dialog.
Note that it works with NVDA 2018.3 or later.
Otherwise, you should disable or uninstall the addon itself for disabling object tracking.

When Focus Highlight category of NVDA Settings dialog is available, following items can be used.

* Make focus mode the default: This checkbox is enabled by default. When it is unchecked, this add-on behaves same as version 5.6 or previous versions, i.e., if browse mode is not available for an app, the focus is shown using the thick red rectangle.
* Focus in focus mode, Focus in browse mode, Navigator object: Each of these groups contains Color, Thickness, and Style.
  * Color: This edit field allows you to type the HTML color code, i.e., six-character hexadecimal number. For example, "ffffff" is white, "ff0000" is red, and so on. Note that "000000" can not be used.
  * Thickness: This edit field allows you to type the thickness of the box. You can enter a value between 1 and 30.
  * Style: The choices are Solid, Dash, Dot, Dash dot, and Dash dot-dot.
* Restore defaults: This button allows you to reset your settings to their original defaults.
