By drawing a colored rectangle, this addon enables partially sighted users, sighted educators, or developers to track the location of the nvda navigator object and the focused object/control.

The following 3 colors are used by this addon:

* Green, to indicate the navigator object.
* Red, to indicate the focused object/control.
* Yellow, to indicate when navigator object and focused object are overlapping.

To disable object tracking, uninstall the addon.
